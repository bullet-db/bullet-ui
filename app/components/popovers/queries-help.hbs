<p>The All Queries page contains a list of all the queries previously saved or run on the specific browser (so saved queries cannot be shared between users or browser without using the linking feature).</p>

<p>From this page, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new query using the query builder by clicking the Build Query button. This does not let you do more advanced things like use arbitrary expressions or casting in your queries</li>
  <li>Create a new BQL query by clicking the BQL Query button. This lets you use the full querying capabilities in Bullet. See <a href="https://bullet-db.github.io/ws/api-bql/">BQL API</a> for more information. BQL queries will be identified with a <i class="fa fa-code"/> before their name and Built queries with a <i class="fa fa-sliders"/> in the table below</li>
  <li>Edit a saved or previously executed query by clicking on the name or description of the query. Note that Bullet only saves the most recent version of the query</li>
  <li>Create a unique link to a saved query. This creates a hyperlink with your encoded query that can be shared with others. It will create a copy of the same query in their UI when opened</li>
  <li>Delete a query by clicking the trash icon that appears when you hover over a row in the table</li>
  <li>
    <p>See the results from a previous run query, by clicking on either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Last Results column, or</li>
      <li>Historical Results column and selecting the timestamp of the desired run.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Delete results only without deleting the query by clicking Historical Results and then Clear History.</li>
</ul>
