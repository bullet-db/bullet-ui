  BQL is the underlying query language used to construct Bullet queries. This page lets you type in a BQL query instead of of building a query. The query building page does not support all the features that BQL lets you do - such as arbitrary expressions with fields, casting.

<h5 class="content-header">BQL</h5>
<p>
  A BQL query looks very similar to a SQL query with some restrictions. Bullet does not support JOINs or nested queries. Essentially, a BQL query is first-order SQL. It also has custom functions to support additional queries in Bullet that are not first-order SQL like QUANTILEs or TOP Ks.

  For examples on how to write BQL queries, see the <a href="https://bullet-db.github.io/ws/api-bql">documentation</a>.
