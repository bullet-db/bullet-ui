  You can use this to perform a Count of distinct values for a set of fields. For each distinct combination of values for the fields you select in this option, a count will be incremented. You <strong>must</strong> select fields. Currently, we do not support peforming count distincts for grouped data.
</p>
<p>
  You can use the display name field to give an optional name to the result field that will contain the count of the distincts for your chosen fields.

  Count Distinct is exact up to <strong>{{settings.defaultValues.sketches.countDistinctMaxEntries}}</strong> unique entries. The value of Count Distinct is approximate after this threshold, with a <strong>bounded maximum error</strong>. For example, for k = 16,384, the error is at most 2.34% at 99.73% confidence. In other words, if your count distinct value was 2,000,000, the real value was somewhere between 1,953,200 and 2,046,800 at 99.73% confidence. The error bounds for other values of k can be seen <a href="https://datasketches.github.io/docs/Theta/ThetaErrorTable.html">here</a>.
