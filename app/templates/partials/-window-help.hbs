  This section lets you configure your windowing. This lets you get multiple results while the query is running instead
  of just one result at the end.
</p>

<h5 class="content-header">Window Types</h5>

<p>There are three main types of windows currently supported.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Based</strong> lets you break up your query duration into chunks of time specified by your Frequency.
      Your selected aggregation is applied for each window and the result is returned to you at the end. This corresponds
      to a <strong>Tumbling</strong> window on time if you have done streaming windowed queries before. Note that,
      Frequency has a configured minimum of <strong>{{settings.defaultValues.sketches.windowEmitFrequencyMinSecs}}</strong>
      seconds and a maximum of your query duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using this window with a Raw Data query, you can also also choose the maximum numbers of rows you want
      per window. The allowed maximum is <strong>{{settings.defaultValues.rawMaxSize}}</strong>. This will return the
      window as soon as this maximum is reached.
    </p>
    <p>For other aggregations, the data has to be collected till the window duration is reached because existing rows
      may be updated with future data. The maximum rows per window is defaulted to
      <strong>{{settings.defaultValues.aggregationMaxSize}}</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Record Based</strong> lets you get your results as they come in. You can now use Frequency to specify how
      many records should be present in each window. This is currently only allowed if your aggregation is Raw Data and
      you may only retrieve your records <strong>one</strong> at a time. These correspond to a class of
      <strong>Sliding</strong> windows in streaming windowed queries parlance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Everything from Start of Query</strong> windows or Additive windows let you perform your aggregation
      since the start of the query. This is only allowed for <strong>Time Based</strong> windows whose aggregation is
      <strong>not Raw Data</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5 class="content-header">Constraints</h5>
<p>
  Windowing is an actively developed area in Bullet, so we have only enabled a few simple window types. Different styles
  of windowing such as <strong>Hopping</strong>, <strong>Session</strong> etc. are planned.
</p>

<h6 class="content-sub-header">Rate Limiting</h6>
<p>
  With Raw Data queries and Record Based windows, it is possible to return entirely too much data from the backend if
  your query is not configured correctly (with no filters, for example). If this happens, your query will be
  <strong>terminated</strong> as you exceed the rate limit. You can find out details in the Result Metadata section
  when that happens.
