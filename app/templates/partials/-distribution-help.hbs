<p>This option is used to get distributions of a field (numeric or a field that can be coerced into a number).</p>

<h5 class="content-header">Types of Distributions</h5>

<h6 class="content-sub-header">Quantiles</h6>
<p>
  If this is chosen, you can get the values at various percentiles in the distribution of the field you are interested in. The percentiles are represented as numbers between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong>. For example, <strong>0.25</strong> means the <strong>25th</strong> percentile and so on. This is the domain for the points you will define.
</p>
<h6 class="content-sub-header">Frequencies (Probability Mass Function)</h6>
<p>
  If this is chosen, you can get a frequency count of values of your field that fell into various intervals (or buckets). The domain is the range of values of your field. You will also get a <strong>probability</strong> (as fraction between 0 and 1) of how much of your data falls into each interval.
</p>
<h6 class="content-sub-header">Cumulative Frequencies (Cumulative Distribution Function)</h6>
<p>
  This option is very similar to the Frequencies option but you instead get a cumulative frequency and probability instead for the intervals.
</p>

<h5 class="content-header">Creating a Domain</h5>

<h6 class="content-sub-header">Evenly Spaced Points</h6>
<p>
  You can choose a number here and it will be used to generate evenly spaced points in the whole range of your domain.
</p>
<p>
  For <strong>Quantiles</strong>, the points will be evenly generated from 0 to 1 (both inclusive). If you chose <strong>11</strong>, then the points will be <strong>[0, 0.1, 0.2, ... 0.9, 1.0]</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  For <strong>Frequencies</strong>, the points will be evenly generated from the minimum value of your field to the maximum value (both inclusive). These points will then be used to create intervals, starting at <strong>-infinity to 1st point, 1st point to 2nd point, ... last point to +infinity</strong>
</p>

<h6 class="content-sub-header">Evenly Spaced Points in a Region</h6>
<p>
  This option is exactly like the Evenly Spaced Option above but you get to define the region with the restriction that for <strong>Quantiles</strong>, it must be in the range from <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong>. You specify a start point, an end point and an increment and Bullet will generate <strong>(end - start) / increment</strong> points. You might use this if your distribution is skewed or you want to see a narrower slice of the domain for your field.
</p>
<h6 class="content-sub-header">Define Points</h6>
<p>
  The completely free-form option where you can define <strong>comma</strong> separated numeric values that are used as either:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Percentile values (between 0 and 1 for <strong>Quantiles</strong>)</li>
  <li>Split locations (for <strong>Frequencies</strong> and <strong>Cumulative Frequencies</strong>) to create intervals</li>
</ul>

<p>An example for <strong>Quantiles</strong> might be <strong>0.1,0.25,0.75,0.99</strong></p>

<p>An example for <strong>Frequencies</strong> might be <strong>5000,10000,-1000,0</strong>. The latter will create the following intervals: <strong>(-infinity to -1000), [-1000 to 0), [0 to 5000), [5000 to 10000), [10000 to +infinity)</strong>.</p>
<p>If the same points were used for <strong>Cumulative Frequencies</strong>, the start point of each interval above would just be <strong>-infinity</strong>.</p>

<h5 class="content-header">Constraints</h5>
<p>
  The maximum number of points that you can create through any of the domain creation options above is <strong>{{settings.defaultValues.distributionMaxNumberOfPoints}}</strong>.
</p>
